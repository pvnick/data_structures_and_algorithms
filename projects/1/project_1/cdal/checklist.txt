* pointer: <yes/no>
* iterator_category: <yes/no>
* self_type: <yes/no>

data members as described in part II:

* value_type: <yes/no>
* difference_type: <yes/no>
* reference: <yes/no>
* pointer: <yes/no>
* iterator_category: <yes/no>
* self_type: <yes/no>
* self_reference: <yes/no>

======================================================================
Part III:
======================================================================
My LIST implementation 100% correctly supports the following
methods as described in part III:

* operator[]: <yes/no>
* operator[] const: <yes/no>

For my LIST's methods 

- I wrote documentation identifying the complete behavior (both normal
  and exceptional) of the method, *AND*

- when something unexpected occurs, the method throws appropriately
  typed exceptions, *AND*

- my implementation behaves 100% precisely as documented, *AND*

- I have proven this by creating a suite of CATCH unit tests for
  the method to verify that the method behaves as documented, *AND*

- the method passes all of those unit tests.

* replace: <yes/no>
* insert: <yes/no>
* push_back: <yes/no>
* push_front: <yes/no>
* remove: <yes/no>
* pop_back: <yes/no>
* pop_front: <yes/no>
* item_at: <yes/no>

My LIST implementation compiles correctly using g++ v4.8.2 on the
OpenBSD VM: <yes/no>

I affirm that all the responsess I have provided above are 100% true.
Should it be determined that any are not 100% true, I agree to take a 0
(zero) on the assignment: <yes/no>
